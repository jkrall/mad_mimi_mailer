= Mad Mimi Mailer

* http://developer.madmimi.com - Learn more about the API used by this gem
* http://madmimi.com - Sign up for a Mad Mimi account

== DESCRIPTION:

Let Mad Mimi handle your HTML emails. This is a drop-in replacement
for ActionMailer.  MadMimiMailer extends ActionMailer::Base, so you
can intermingle normal ActionMailer emails with emails sent via
Mad Mimi.  Just start your Mad Mimi-specific emails with
deliver_mimi_foo and it will send your Mad Mimi promotion named "foo".
Oh, and it will also automatically import the recipient into your
Mad Mimi account.

Optionally, you can keep your existing mailer method names, and use the
send_with_mad_mimi class method to direct the MadMimiMailer to send
specific emails with Mad Mimi:

  class UserNotifier < MadMimiMailer
    send_with_mad_mimi :custom_mimi_email
    def custom_mimi_email(user)
      subject "This will send with Mad Mimi!"
      recipients user.email
    end
  end


== TODO:

* If something goes wrong with the call to Mad Mimi, fallback and use plain old local Rails templates.
* Document how body data can be used in Mad Mimi templates
* Document promotion, hidden, and use_erb options

== SYNOPSIS:

  class UserNotifier < MadMimiMailer
    def mimi_welcome(user)
      subject "Welcome to WidgetHub"
      recipients user.email
      bcc ADMIN_PEEPS
      from "admin@example.com"
      body :username => user.name, :email => user.email, :password => user.password    
    end
  
    def reset(user)
      subject "Resetting your WidgetHub account"
      recipients user.email
      bcc ADMIN_PEEPS
      from "admin@example.com"
      body :user => user
    end
  end

  MadMimiMailer.api_settings = {
    :username => 'dave@example.com',
    :api_key => '75a6c6f1SomeFakeApiKeycbcc300'
  }

  # Sent via Mad Mimi
